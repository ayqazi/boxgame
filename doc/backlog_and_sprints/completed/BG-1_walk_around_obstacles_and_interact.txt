BG-1 Walk around obstacles and interact
=======================================

1. As player, I want to be able to see a world on the screen because
it draws me into the game and allows a story to develop that keeps me
playing.(done)

2. As player, I want to see a representation of myself on the screen
as it will make me empathise with it and allow me to be imersed in the
game through its point of view, and let it be a focal point of all my
interactions. (done)

3. As player, I want to move my character around the world as
exploring a world will make me want to keep playing. (done)

4. As player, I want to not be allowed to move outside the boundaries
of the world, as that makes things unrealistic and breaks the
immersion factor I may have developed by moving around the world,
thinking I was actually in it. (done)

5. As player, I want to quit when I press Escape or the q key, as not
being able to quit a running program I do not want brings frustration
and will make me annoyed with the game and not play it again. (done)

6. As player, I do not want to move through obstacles in my path
without a reason as that makes things unrealistic and breaks immersion
which will make me lose interest in the game. (done)

7. As player, I want to know which direction I am facing, as this will
determine how I interact with things and I do not want to be frustrated
with having to remember the last key I pressed! (done)

8. As player, I want to be able to interact with objects in front of
me, as an interactive world is an interesting world that I want to
stay in. (done)
