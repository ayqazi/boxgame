BG-X Backlog
============

General
-------

X. As the coder, I want a fixed timestep model governing when game
logic is processed as it makes time-based calculations simpler and
lets me replay events later, easing debugging and allowing for more
test-driven development to take place.

X. As the player, I want the framerate to be decoupled from the game
logic rate as it make the games smoother to play and a more pleasant
experience.

X. As the player, I want to use my nice powerful 3D hardware to be
used to make the game faster, as non-jerky frame-rates make for a more
pleasant and immersive experience for me.

RPG
---

X. As the player, I want a more convincing avatar that faces 8
directions because the more I associate with the game, the more I want
to play.

X. As the player, I want to see my avatar being animated while it
carries out various actions because seeing a more dynamic game world
draws me into it which keeps me playing.

X. As the player, I want to see NPCs as more variety in the game makes
me want to explore and interact which draws me in and keeps me playing.
